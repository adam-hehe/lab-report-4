# Lab Report 4 -Vim

For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

Keys Pressed: `ssh<space>adconnor@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu<enter>`. This command logged me into `ieng6-201`, I was not asked for my password because I have already generated an `ssh` key on my computer.

## Step 5

Keys Pressed: `git<space>clone<space><cmd>-v`. The `<cmd>-v` command pasted the ssh link connected with my Github account. The purpose of using the ssh github link is so that I am able to clone and push my changes onto my lab7 fork.
